## 🧠 Abstract

With the rise of 6G and IIoT, the number of smart devices and the data they generate is exploding. This paper proposes a **hybrid D2D communication framework** using:

- 🌐 **Edge Computing**
- 🧿 **Digital Twin Networks (DTN)**
- 🤝 **Federated Reinforcement Learning**
- 🧬 **Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO)**

The approach significantly enhances:
- ✅ Throughput (↑ 25%)
- ✅ Latency (↓ 30%)
- ✅ Resource Utilization Efficiency

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **Digital Twin (DT):** Virtual representations of IIoT devices & access points for real-time coordination
- **D2D Communication:** Reduces latency by direct device-to-device data transfer
- **Edge Computing:** Brings compute closer to the user, offloading cloud reliance
- **BPSO + FRL:** Used for distributed, privacy-preserving resource optimization
